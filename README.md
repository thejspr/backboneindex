# Backbone Index

Backbone aims at making the discovery of Backbone resources and plugins easier.
This is achieved by parsing the official Backbone wiki pages and displaying the
information on a [webpage](http://backboneindex.com).

## Rationale

I initiated this project with the aim of making something useful whilst learning
Backbone.

## Roadmap

* Filter by keyword/search.
* Add more pages from the Backbone wiki

## Contributing

1. Create an issue describing your proposed feature/fix/request.
2. Once consensus has been made, hack away!
