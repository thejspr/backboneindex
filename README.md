# Backbone Index

Backbone Index aims at making the discovery of Backbone resources and plugins easier.
This is achieved by parsing the official Backbone wiki pages and displaying the
information on a [webpage](http://backboneindex.com).

## Rationale

I initiated this project with the aim of making something useful whilst learning
Backbone.

## Status

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/thejspr/backboneindex.png)](https://travis-ci.org/thejspr/backboneindex)

## Development

The `bin` directory contains scripts for building, testing and releasing the
application. To update the Backbone wiki, go to `parser/backbone.wiki` and `git
pull`. To get started, run `./bin/setup`

## Roadmap

* Filter by keyword/search.
* Add more pages from the Backbone wiki
